Hate speech can be defined as abusive or threatening speech or writing that expresses prejudice against a person or a particular group, especially on the basis of race, religion, nationality, gender, identity factors and so on.
As online content continues to expand, so does hate speech. While People may still have differences, they mostly learned to keep it civil in everyday face-to-face interaction, but unfortunately, the situation is widely different on social media. Hate speech became an everyday occurrence online, and it’s been linked to a global increase in violence toward minorities, risk of mental health issues, and so on. 

This project is an attempt to limit the spread of hate speech on social media, and it’s dedicated to all of those who got affected by it.

The aim of my project is to find the most accurate machine learning algorithm, that can identify hate speech from text and label it as hateful.

The Process:

1.	EDA 
2.	Pre-processing
3.	Building machine learning models using the following algorithms:
o	Random Forest
o	SVM
o	Naïve bayes
o	XGBoost
o	Deep learning (RNN, CNN)
4.	Model evaluation and comparison
5.	Using best models to predict unseen data.

Sample of Results:

Conclusion:

I explored different classifiers trained on a combined dataset from different social media sources, The deep learning classifiers outperformed the other models in detecting hate speech, while the SVC model came next in score. 
For better performance and future work, I would recommend using feature engineering, combining two models, and work on each hateful subject separately.

** it’s important to note that this dataset contains text that can be considered racist, sexist, or generally offensive.
